Hi EPFO Office,

I joined Mercer India (new employer)on 6th April 2020 and my previous employer(SAPIENT CONSULTING PRIVATE LIMITED) has PF Trust hence I requested them to transfer the PF account. I received the confirmation from my previous Employer that they have transferred PF to my Mercer PF account.
But when I check passbook over EPFO nothing is coming there. But the claim Status is showing as settled. Please find the attached Annexure-K given by my ex-employer.

Please help me regarding this and let me know how can I have my updated passbook and how can I see my honest PF money in my Mercer PF account? 

Details of UAN and accounts are as below-
UAN Account- 100978227110
Mercer PF Account- GNGGN00294360000019396- In this account all PF amount needs to be transferred.
Sapient PF Account- GNGGN00306590000029253- From this account PF amount was transferred.


Please reply as soon as possible. Please treat this as urgent request. I have some urgency.
